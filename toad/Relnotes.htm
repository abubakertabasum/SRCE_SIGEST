    <a name="new">Version History</a></h2>
	
      <p><u>Version 4.5:</u>
      <p><b>Syntax</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Added PL/SQL datatype STRING (subtype of VARCHAR).</li>
        <li>CREATE [OR REPLACE] TYPE ... TABLE OF .. INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER
          removed, since this PL/SQL construct does not exist in SQL.</li>
        <li>Fixed GPF when the input stream consists of an interrupted (unended)
          tag line only.</li>
        <li>table@dblink%TYPE and %ROWTYPE was not supported</li>
        <li>When the cursor is positioned somewhere on the tagline on the first
          line (but not at the very beginning) then the formatter produces a
          general protection fault window (GPF when the input file is an
          incomplete tagline ONLY)</li>
        <li>ALTER USER &lt;user&gt; DEFAULT ROLE RESOURCE;&nbsp; was not
          accepted (nor DEFAULT ROLE CONNECT)</li>
        <li>Variable/constant declarations have to precede any
          function/procedure bodies, but not necessarily function/procedure
          declarations.</li>
        <li>Added 8.0 LOB index clause (deprecated as of 8i)</li>
        <li>PRAGMA RESTRICT_REFERENCES didn't support assertions (RNDS etc.)
          between single quotes</li>
        <li>A single period (.) at the end of a PL/SQL definition shouldn't
          cause 'Expecting end of statement' error. This is the legitimate
          method of telling the SQLPlus interpreter that the PL/SQL definition
          is complete.</li>
        <li>In ALTER TABLESPACE, the autoextend clause was mandatory and caused
          the token AUTOEXTEND to be expected.</li>
        <li>An enumeration of REUSEd files in an ALTER TABLESPACE ADD DATAFILE
          now works :<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALTER TABLESPACE stocks ADD DATAFILE<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'diskc:stock4.dat' REUSE AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT
          100K,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'diskc:stock5.dat' REUSE AUTOEXTEND OFF</li>
        <li>AUTHID / DETERMINISTIC / PARALLEL_ENABLE clauses : only one keyword
          is supported instead of a list of them.</li>
        <li>ESCAPE &lt;expression&gt; in a LIKE predicate was not supported.</li>
        <li>The col attribute in the INFO XML structure was erroneous (it
          actually had the value 1 + lineno)&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>&nbsp;Formatting</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added capability to indent and undent code depending on procedure
          names, useful when writing HTML generating code using HTP procedures.
          In Options GUI : see Indenting page.</li>
        <li>Some keywords were not capitalized. Now, some keywords only used in
          DDL will always be capitalized as keywords. This will be enhanced in a
          the next release.</li>
        <li>The keyword AND in the WHERE clauses of DML statements was aligned
          to the leftmost margin when the keywords where left aligned.</li>
        <li>AUTHID / DETERMINISTIC / PARALLEL_ENABLE clauses : these tokens were
          not output, and yielded an output difference</li>
        <li>The linefeed switch &quot;Around a DML statement&quot; didn't work
          for SELECT statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Profiler&nbsp;</b>
      <ul>
        <li># code lines was increased with the # leading blank lines</li>
        <li>List of built-in functions and packages updated to 9.0.1</li>
        <li>Function BITAND now flagged as 8.1.7 rather than 8.1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Code Review</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Message for advice #101 &quot;<i>Comparison with NULL always yields
          FALSE, try using IS [NOT] NULL&quot;</i> fixed to &quot;<i>... always
          yields NULL ...</i>&quot;</li>
        <li>Message for advice #111 &quot;<i>In Oracle 8, VARCHAR2 variables of
          zero length are not equivalent to a NULL&quot;</i> changed to:<br>
          <br>
          <font size="2">&quot;<i>In Oracle 8, VARCHAR2 variables of zero length
          assigned to CHAR variables will blank-pad these rather than making
          them NULL</i>&quot;</font><br>
          <br>
          Changed rationale to :<br>
          <br>
          <font size="2">&quot;<i>In Oracle 8, VARCHAR2 variables of zero length
          are not equivalent to a NULL assigned to CHAR variables will blank-pad
          these rather than making them NULL.</i>&nbsp; <i>According to the ANSI
          SQL 1992 Transitional standard, a zero-length or empty string is not
          the same as NULL.The following example shows this behaviour :</i><br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; DECLARE</i><br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v&nbsp; varchar2(3);</i><br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c&nbsp; char(3);</i><br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; BEGIN</i><br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v := null;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          -- (v IS NULL) yields TRUE</i><br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c := v;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          -- (c IS NULL) yields TRUE</i><br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v := '';&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          -- (v IS NULL) yields TRUE</i><br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c := v;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          -- (c IS NULL) yields FALSE (c is blank-padded)</i><br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; END;</i><br>
          <i>Currently the Oracle kernel does not comply with this aspect of the
          standard, but PL/SQL does. This non-agreement with the kernel is seen
          as a bug.</i><br>
          <i>Currently the appropriate bugfix (727361) is disabled so that
          PL/SQL remains ANSI compliant. </i>&quot;</font></li>
        <li>Added advice #125 (Test on implicit cursor is not reliable)<br>
          Severity: warning<br>
          Rationale: &quot;<i>A procedure or function between the SQL operation
          and the test (SQL%...) may influence the test result.</i>&quot;</li>
        <li>Added advice #126 (Test on implicit cursor follows explicit cursor
          operation)<br>
          Severity: warning<br>
          Rationale : &quot;<i>An explicit cursor operation (cursor%...) was
          followed by a test designed for implicit cursors (SQL%...).</i>&quot;</li>
        <li>Added advice #127 (Label undefined)<br>
          Severity: severe<br>
          Rationale : &quot;<i>At least one statement referred to the label, but
          its definition was not found.</i>&quot;</li>
        <li>Added advice #130 (At most one declaration for this item is
          permitted).<br>
          Severity: severe.<br>
          Rationale &quot;<i>The item has been declared multiple times, possibly
          one time as label. Labels share the name space of variables so that
          labels and variables with a same name. The Oracle equivalent error
          message is PLS-00371.</i>&quot;</li>
        <li>Added advice #131 (This item has not been declared, or it refers to
          a label).<br>
          Severity: severe.<br>
          Rationale &quot;<i>The Oracle equivalent error messages are&nbsp;
          PLS-00320 and PLS-0321.</i>&quot;.</li>
        <li>Rationale added to message #313 (Use of DELETE or UPDATE without
          WHERE clause) :<br>
          &quot;<i>The abscense of the WHERE clause will cause the statement to
          affect the whole table.</i><br>
          <i>This could be an inefficient operation, unless the table is
          relatively small.</i></li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p><i>Consider using TRUNCATE if you want to delete all records&quot;,</i>&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Added advice #420 (The label near the END of the block doesn't match
          the block label, or a block label is missing)<br>
          Severity : warning.<br>
          Rationale : &quot;<i>Oracle allows any label to be associated with the
          END statement. However, for clarity it should match the start label.</i>&quot;</li>
        <li>Added advice #421 (The label near the END of the loop doesn't match
          the loop label, or a loop label is missing)<br>
          Severity : warning.<br>
          Rationale : &quot;<i>Oracle allows any label to be associated with the
          END statement. However, for clarity it should match the start label.</i>&quot;</li>
        <li>Added advice #422 (This label looks like a procedure call)<br>
          Severity : warning.<br>
          Rationale : &quot;<i>Since the END or END LOOP label has not been
          written on the same line, it looks as if it was the intention to call
          a procedure. Add a semicolon after the END [LOOP] if it was not.</i>&quot;</li>
        <li>Added advice #530 (Use of <b>Backward</b> GOTO).<br>
          Severity : warning.<br>
          Rationale : &quot;<i>A GOTO statement is an unstructured change in the
          control flow. Worse, the label does not require an indicator of where
          the corresponding GOTO statement(s) are. This makes code unreadable
          and makes its correct execution suspect.</i><br>
          <i>Other languages use GOTO statements to implement loop exits and
          exception handling. PL/SQL's support of these constructs makes the
          GOTO statement extremely rare.</i><br>
          <i>Maybe a forward GOTO can be tolerated, since it may simulate an
          exit or a return, but a backward GOTO should definitely be replaced by
          a LOOP statement.</i>&quot;</li>
        <li>Rationale of message #556 (This definition hides another one) fixed
          as follows :<br>
          &quot;<i>(Is it a FOR LOOP variable ?)</i>&quot; replaced by &quot;<i>(Is
          it a FOR loop index or record ?)</i>&quot;</li>
        <li>Rationale of message #558 (This item should be defined in a deeper
          scope) extended with this phrase : &quot;<i>It may be required to add
          extra anonymous blocks and move top level declarations down to these
          blocks.</i>&quot;&nbsp;<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p><u>Version 4.4</u>:</p>

        <li>Enhanced overall formatting of lists and nested statements</li>
      </ul>
	
      <p>
	
	<B>Options issues:</B><ul>
    <li>Added controls for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE formatting</li>
    <li>Add ability to align SELECT statement lists at a specific column or use
      dynamic alignment.</li>
    <li>Added capitalization for DDL statements</li>
    <li>Added line feed for around program units, anonymous blocks, views,
      triggers, and object types</li>

	</ul>

	<B>Dependency issues:</B><ul>
    <li>Fixed flagging built-in package DBMS_DEBUG as 7.3 instead of 8.1</li>
	</ul>
		
	
      <b>Other&nbsp; issues:</b><ul>
    <li>In declaration of blocks, procedures and functions, Formatter Plus now
      checks that local procedures/functions are declared <i>after</i> variables
      and types</li>
    <li>Fixed extra line feeds inserted after formatting header</li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Fixed formatting of ORDER BY. ORDER BY did
      not follow the alignment of the other SELECT keywords and lists.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Removed extra line inserted before stacked
      lists.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Fixed alignment of stacked
      parameters.&nbsp; The first parameter was sometimes indented an extra
      space.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Fixed line breaks on long concatenation
      assignments.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Fixed auto-removal of comments inserted by
      Formatter Plus.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Formatter Plus comments are reviewed for
      obsolescence each time you format.&nbsp; Obsolete comments are
      automatically removed now.</font></li>
	</ul>
		
	
	<h2>
    <a name="restrictions">Known restrictions</a></h2>
    <p>Here are the main restrictions that apply to this version of the
    product&nbsp;:
      <ul>
	
      <li><strong>Constructs that are not (yet) parsed<br>
        </strong>The constructs listed here will be supported in a future release :<ul>
          <li>Wrapped program units (especially as part of a large script)</li>
          <li>Oracle Context SQL.</li>
		  
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Formatter Plus will not parse the package <tt>SYS</tt>.<tt><strong>STANDARD</strong></tt>.
        Its code is not considered to be regular and documented user code. It is rarely modified, and interpreting it each time would decrease
        processing speed. </li>
      <li>SQL*Plus code with <strong>substitution variables </strong>(<tt>&amp;varname</tt>) will be parsed by Formatter Plus. However, if you use the substitution mechanism to replace a
        single word by many words then parsing is impossible.<br>
        In general, any preprocessed SQL or PL/SQL like language will not parse.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2><br>
    <a name="remarks">General remarks</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Formatter Plus works on code that has <strong>no Oracle syntax errors</strong>, i.e. the code must be compilable or executable on Oracle. When a piece of code has Oracle errors, in many cases Formatter Plus will fail too. However, Formatter Plus is more permissive than the PL/SQL compiler or SQL*Plus environment.<br>  Formatter Plus can thus be used to do a quick syntax check on your code.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>right margin</strong> setting is only a guideline for Formatter Plus.  It is  not a hard limit. Although Formatter Plus will do the very best to keep all text within that margin it cannot guarantee it, especially with very large comments.<br>
        An exception to this is when Forms 3 is formatted, then a right margin of 73 is enforced,
        i.e. any overflowing text is word wrapped to a new line.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Formatter Plus distinguishes two kind of comments :<ul>
          <li><strong>Comment on a line(s) by itself</strong><br>
            These kind of comments are always associated with the token <em>following</em> the comment. They will align to that token. Header blocks belong to this type of comments.</li>
          <li><strong>End-of-line (and inline) comment<br>
            </strong>Comments written at the end of a line after a token (e.g<tt>. a := 1; -- addition</tt>)
            and comments in between instructions (e.g.<tt>, a /*total*/ := b /*amount*/ * c /*price*/</tt>)
            are always associated with the token <em>preceding</em> them.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Formatter Plus <strong>always compares its output data to the input data</strong>. When it finds differences other than white space (spaces, tabs, new lines), Lowercase-Uppercase differences or special Formatter Plus comments, then it will <em>never</em> produce output data.<br>
        Single line comments (- - .....) are guarded by special program logic that ensures that
        any program code token following such line <em>must</em> appear on a new line.<em><strong><br>
        When Formatter Plus finds even the smallest difference then it will NOT reformat your input file(s).<br>
        </strong></em>This is particularly important during physical replacement of files and database texts by reformatted versions. Comparison is done in memory and consumes only a minimal fraction of the total CPU processing time.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>You can always run Formatter Plus <strong>multiple times</strong> against the same source file. The data produced by running
        Formatter Plus on a previously formatted source is identical to that source (except the timestamp on the tag line). Reformatting multiple times does <em>not</em> further improve formatting.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><a name="view about formatting"><strong>Our view about formatting</strong></a><br>
        We targeted the &quot;hard stuff&quot; first, i.e. trying to answer questions such as :
        &quot;<em>I have queries with subqueries and complex WHERE clauses with many nested levels
        of ANDs and ORs, and nested function calls. They are extremely hard to understand. How can
        I have these large and complex statements formatted as clear and transparent as possible?
        Which format is the best to help me to instantly discover any logical errors? What is a
        good common style such that any member of our team will have less difficulty in
        understanding the colleague's code?&quot;</em><P>
        In this perspective Formatter Plus is not merely a &quot;pretty printer&quot;. Pretty
        printers, beautifiers and code polishers mostly traverse input while trying to recognize
        patterns, after which they rearrange pieces and output them. Formatter Plus on the other
        hand could never succeed in formatting very complex constructs without parsing and
        analyzing the source code first, just the same way a compiler does.<br>
        <br>
        Formatter Plus' <em>structured source code formatting</em>  allows any PL/SQL programmer to be able to read and understand
		a colleague's code. This means that switching people between projects will be
        less costly, because now there is one less obstacle to overcome : they
        already formally understand the code of their colleagues and can begin immediately to work on it.  In this way, Formatter Plus boosts the flexibility in your team.<br>
        <br>
        Formatting can always be improved. We're certainly not through yet. We'll continue adding
        new functions and polishing existing functionalities. Your feedback is welcome at any
        time.  We will read it and address the issues raised. We'll add more preferences over time.
        Cosmetic issues are at least as important as the pure code formatting, although likely
        more subject to personal preferences (and there are many of them ...). Again, we would
        certainly appreciate your comments in helping us adding or enhancing Formatter Plus' functionalities.<br>
