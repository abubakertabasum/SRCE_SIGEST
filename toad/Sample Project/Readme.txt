                                        Formatter Plus 
                                        Sample Project

This sample project is included to illustrate one of the many ways that you can organize 
your source code files using Formatter Plus.   Our sample project includes PL/SQL packages 
based on a Human Resources system.  

Each file has been pre-formatted with minimal formatting to provide you with an opportunity 
to test Formatter's numerous formatting style options.  We've also introduced some "not 
recommended" coding principles into many of the modules to illustrate Formatter's ability 
to provide advice on areas of your code that  might be able to be improved as well as a 
variety of PL/SQL constructs to illustrate Formatter's profiling capabilities.

Please note that this project and its files are used extensively in the Quick Tour included 
in the Formatter Plus help system to illustrate Formatter's capabilities.  We highly 
recommend that you take a few minutes to take this tour of Formatter Plus.  You can access 
it by clicking on Help+Quick Tour on the Formatter Plus command bar.

While you can add files and folders to this project, we recommend that you not save changes 
to this file so that you will always have a ready set of files that will work in concert 
with the help system and quick tour.
