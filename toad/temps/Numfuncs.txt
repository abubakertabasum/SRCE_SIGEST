*ABS(n)
Returns the absolute value of N.
*ACOS(n)
Returns the arc cosine of N.

Inputs are in the range of -1 to 1, and outputs are in the range of 0 to pi and are expressed in radians.
*ASIN(n)
Returns the arc sine of N.

Inputs are in the range of -1 to 1, and outputs are in the range of -pi/2 to pi/2 and are expressed in radians.
*ATAN(n)
Returns the arc tangent of N.

Inputs are in an unbounded range, and outputs are in the range of -pi/2 to pi/2 and are expressed in radians.
*ATAN2(n,m)
Returns the arc tangent of N and M.

Inputs are in an unbounded range, and outputs are in the range of -pi to pi, depending on the signs of x and y, and are expressed in radians.  Atan2(x,y) is the same as Atan2(x/y).
*CEIL(n)
Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to N.  (see FLOOR)
*COS(n)
Returns the cosine of N (an angle expressed in radians).
*COSH(n)
Returns the hyperbolic cosine of N.
*EXP(n)
Returns e raised to the Nth power, where e = 2.71828183...
*FLOOR(n)
Returns largest integer equal to or less than N.  (see CEIL)
*LN(n)
Returns the natural logarithm of N where N > 0
*LOG(m,n)
Returns the logarithm, base M, of N.

The base M can be any positive number other than 0 or 1 and N can be any positive number.
*MOD(m,n)
Returns remainder of M divided by N.  Returns M if N is 0.
*POWER(m,n)
Returns M raised to the Nth power.

The base M and the exponent N can by any numbers, but if M is negative, N must be an integer.
*ROUND(n [,m])
Returns N rounded to M places right of the decimal point.  M defaults to 0.

M can be negative to round off digits left of the decimal point.  M must be an integer.
*SIGN(n)
if N < 0 then -1;  if N = 0 then 0;  if N > 0 then 1
*SIN(n)
Returns the sine of N (an angle expressed in radians).
*SINH(n)
Returns the hyperbolic sine of N.
*SQRT(n)
Returns square root of N;  if N < 0 then NULL
*TAN(n)
Returns the tangent of N (an angle expressed in radians).
*TANH(n)
Returns the hyperbolic tangent of N.
*TRUNC(n [,m])
Returns N truncated to M decimal places;  M defaults to 0.

M can be negative to truncate (make zero) M digits left of the decimal point.
