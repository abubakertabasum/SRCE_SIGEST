*/*+ RULE */
Use the old rule based optimizer.  See Notes.
*/*+ CHOOSE */
If any of the tables or indexes in the statement are analyzed, use the Cost Based Optimizer otherwise use the Rule Based.  See Notes.
*/*+ ALL_ROWS */
Uses the Cost Based Optimizer if tables or indexes are analyzed.  Recommended for predominantly for batch processing systems.  See Notes.
*/*+ FIRST_ROWS */
Uses the Cost Based Optimizer if tables or indexes are analyzed. Recommended for OLTP processing.  See Notes.
*Notes
Consider using the INIT.ora OPTIMIZER_MODE parameter rather than using RULE, CHOOSE, ALL_ROWS, or FIRST_ROWS.
*/*+ AND_EQUAL (table_name index_name index_name2)*/
Use to join single column indexes.  At least 2 indexes must be specified.
*/*+ APPEND */
Inserts statements add data at the end of a table without using any freespace in the table. v8
*/*+ CACHE */
Moves blocks read into the most recently used area of the buffer cache so the data in the buffer cache will be retained longer.
*/*+ CLUSTER(table_name) */
Forces a cluster scan for a specified table.
*/*+ COST */
Use cost-based optimizer
*/*+ FULL(table_name) */
Use a full table scan on the specified table
*/*+ HASH(table_name) */
Use a hash scan to access the specified table.
*/*+ HASH_AJ(table_name)*/
Use a hash anti-join to speed up NOT IN clause. v7.3 and later.
*/*+ INDEX(table_name index_name)*/
Force the use of a specific index for the specified table.
*/*+ INDEX_ASC(table_name index_name) */
Same as INDEX
*/*+ INDEX_DESC(table_name index_name)*/
Same as INDEX but in descending order.
*/*+ INDEX_COMBINE(table_name index_name)*/
Use a specific index on the specified table.  Used with bitmap indexes. v8 only.
*/*+ INDEX_FFS(table_name index_name)*/
Use a full index scan on the specified index.  v8 only
*/*+ MERGE_AJ(table_name) */
NOT IN will be processed using a Merge Join
*/*+ NOAPPEND */
Overrides APPEND (inserts in parallel mode default to APPEND) to add data using any freespace. v8
*/*+ NOCACHE */
Moves blocks read into the least recently used area of the buffer cache so the data in the buffer cache will be purged sooner.
*/*+ NOPARALLEL (table_name num_processes)*/
Overrides parallelism set for a table and runs in non parallel mode.
*/*+ ORDERED */
Access tables using the order in the FROM statement, from left to right.
*/*+ PARALLEL (table_name num_processes)*/
Sets the number of parallel processors to scan the specified table.  Variation: PARALLEL (table_name num_processes, num_servers)
*/*+ USE_CONCAT */
Any ORs in the WHERE statement will be transformed into UNION ALLs.
*/*+ USE_HASH */
Tables are joined using a hash join. v8
*/*+ USE_MERGE */
Use nested loop join technique on specified tables
*/*+ USE_NL (table_name table_name2)*/
Use nested loop join technique between specified tables
