IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THIS SOFTWARE AND PROMPTLY RETURN IT TO QUEST SOFTWARE.<br>
<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
This agreement is made between Quest Software, Inc. (hereafter referred to as "Quest Software" and you, the customer, (hereafter referred to as "LICENSEE").  For the purpose of this agreement, the purchased computer software program(s) and supporting documentation will be referred to as the "Software".<br>
<br>
1.	License.  The enclosed Software is licensed, not sold, to LICENSEE by Quest Software.  Quest Software reserves any rights not expressly granted to LICENSEE.  Quest Software retains title and full ownership rights under the copyright laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction or under any federal, state, or foreign laws.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
2.	Use.  This License allows LICENSEE to:<br>
(a) For the number of copies purchased, use one copy of the Software on a single computer at a time at the authorized sites for which the Software is purchased.

<br>
(b) Make one copy for each copy purchased of the Software in machine-readable form solely for backup purposes.  As an express condition of this License, LICENSEE must reproduce on each copy any copyright notice or other proprietary notice that is on the original copy supplied by Quest Software.<br>
<br>
(c) Notwithstanding any other terms in this License, if the Software is licensed as an upgrade or update, then LICENSEE may only use the Software to replace valid previously licensed versions of the same software.  LICENSEE agrees that the upgrade or update does not constitute the granting of an additional license to the Software (i.e., you may not use the upgrade or update in addition to the software it is replacing, nor may you transfer the software which is being replaced to a third party).<br>
<br>
3. Transfer.  LICENSEE may not transfer Software without prior acceptance by Quest Software.<br>
<br>
4. Restrictions.

<br>
6. Maintenance.  If maintenance is purchased along with the Software, Quest Software will invoice LICENSEE annually for the software maintenance fees for the period from thirty (30) days from the commencement of this license agreement and every year after.  LICENSEE may elect not to renew maintenance for the Software by not paying the fee, in which case Quest Software will no longer be responsible for providing maintenance.

<br>
7. Termination.  This License is effective until terminated.  LICENSEE must notify Quest Software in writing of termination within 30 days prior to the expiration of the current maintenance period.  Payment of any and all back maintenance is required for any License to be reinstated after termination date.  This License will terminate immediately with out notice from Quest Software or judicial resolution if LICENSEE fails to comply with any provision of this License.  Upon such termination LICENSEE must destroy the Software, all accompanying written materials and all copies thereof, and Sections 8, 9, 10 and 11 will survive any termination.<br>
<br>

Quest Software’s entire liability and your sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of the foregoing limited warranty will be, at Quest Software’s option, replacement of the media, refund of the purchase price or repair or replacement of the Software.<br>
<br>
THIS LIMITED WARRANTY IS THE ONLY WARRANTY PROVIDED BY QUEST SOFTWARE AND ITS LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE AND ACCOMPANYING WRITTEN MATERIALS.&nbsp;<br>

Confidential Information shall be limited to the Software, the terms and pricing under this Agreement, and all information clearly identified as confidential.<br>
<br>
11. Injunctive Relief and Cumulative Remedies.  LICENSEE hereby expressly agrees that Quest Software, in addition to any other rights or remedies which Quest Software may possess, shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief without having to post bond or other security to prevent a breach or continuing breach of this Software License Agreement.  No remedy conferred on Quest Software by any specific provisions of this License Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given herein or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.  The election of any one or more remedies by Quest Software shall not constitute a waiver of the right to pursue other available remedies.<br>
<br>
12. General.  This license will be construed under the laws of the State of California, except for that body of law dealing with conflicts of law.  In the event there is a dispute concerning the subject matter of this agreement, the proper venue shall be the County of Orange, State of California, United States of America.  If any provision of this License shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of this License will remain in full force and effect.  If the Software is supplied to the United States Government, the Software is classified as "restricted computer software" as defined in clause 52.227-19 of the FAR.&nbsp;<br>
