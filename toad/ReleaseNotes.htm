<p><font size="5"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>
<p>These Release Notes are intended to provide an overview of new functionality  
and to list many of the fixes that have been implemented in this release of TOAD.  The 
Release Notes are also intended to help you upgrade to the new version. For an introduction to TOAD, also see readme.txt.</p>
<p>TOAD 7.2 includes a Script Manager for managing your scripts, a Configure Tools window, from which you can configure TOAD to launch
other applications, and an optional Task Bar that shows your open connections.  The Schema Browser has 3 new tabs.  The Queues and Queue Tables 
tabs are for use with Oracle Advanced Queuing.  The Types tab, which shows Object Types and Collection Types, has taken over the functionality of the earlier Object Browser, which has been removed from TOAD.  
TOAD 7.2 is also the first version of TOAD to be tested on Oracle 9i.  A Space Manager for collecting statistics on tablespace usage has been added to the DBA module.  The Procedure Editor 
has been rewritten, and many fixes have been implemented for the Debugger, the Compare Schemas window, and the Generate Schema Script window, as well as in other
places throughout TOAD.  We believe that you will be very pleased with this new version.

  <tr>    <td><font size="4"><b>TOAD Security</b></font></td>
</tr><tr>    <td>The TOAD Security Feature has new functionality. If you are upgrading to TOAD 7.2 and have already set up your security features in a previous version of TOAD, you can run an upgrade script so you do not have to recreate the security tables and reassign all of the privileges.  You will need to open the TOADSECURITY_Update.SQL file in the SQL Editor and execute in the TOAD schema on the target instance. This will truncate the TOAD_FEATURES table and insert the new and / or relabeled features.  After you run the upgrade script, you will need to go back into the TOAD Features Security window and make sure everyone has the correct privileges for TOAD 7.2.  If you are upgrading from 7.1 to 7.2, then instead of running the upgrade script, you can simply run the following statement in order to upgrade:
<p></p>
INSERT INTO TOAD.TOAD_FEATURES ( NAME, DESCR ) VALUES (
'CHAINED ROWS', 'DBA Menu, Chained Rows Window');</td>

<p><font size="5"><b>Oracle 9i Support</b></font></p>

<p>TOAD 7.2 has been fully tested on Oracle 9i.  If TOAD supports a feature on an Oracle 8i database, then it is also expected
to support that feature on an Oracle 9i database.  However, support for most new features of Oracle 9i has not yet been added to TOAD.

  <tr valign="top">    <td>Space Manager</td>

These tabs, along with the set of tables and views in the TOAD schema that populate the graphs on these tabs as well as the new Toad_Spaceman package in the TOAD schema, comprise what is
called the TOAD Space Manager.

The Space History tab provides a graph showing historical
space usage of tablespaces and datafiles.

The IO History tab shows a historical graph of various IO
metrics, such as physical reads and writes.

To begin using this new feature, one must first create the
tables and job which drives the population of the tables.  To do so:
<ul>
<li>connect as TOAD and open DBA | Tablespaces</li>
<li>click the toolbar button on the far left of either of the new tabs, whose hint reads 'Create/Recreate Space Manager Tables'.  If you are not the TOAD user you will be prevented from doing this.</li>
</ul>
Clicking OK for first time setup creates the tables, views, SM package and job, and backfills the tables if specified.
<p></p>
Afterward, any user can then click the 'Edit Space Manager Settings' button to modify the job and history retention settings.
<ul>
<li>The collection status group box at the top gives you the status of the SM job and allows you to toggle the status.</li>

<li>The collection schedule controls operate like the Create Job
window. The user can choose the frequency with which the SM job executes the TOAD_SPACEMAN.Collect() procedure.</li>

<li>The 'History Retention' group box specifies how much data should be kept in the SM tables.  Whenever the SM job runs it first removes old data.</li>

<li>The 'Data Initialization' group box offers the user the choice of starting with empty tables or 'back filling' the tables with data showing increasing space usage over time given the current space utitlization as the start.  This only applies to first time setup.</li>
